var exampleStudent = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 20,
    classes: ["Math", "Science", "English"]
};
// Log the example student's information
console.log("Student Information:");
console.log("Name:", exampleStudent.name);
console.log("Age:", exampleStudent.age);
console.log("Classes:", exampleStudent.classes.join(", "));
